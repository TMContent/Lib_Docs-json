      "4.0 is a major rewrite of TEAM Mentor under new architecture.

It algorithmically presents the most relevant articles and allows to further narrow down results with robust filtering\n- Improved ability to browse content. Users can now browse by subject matter, technology, article type and other keywords. Progressively narrowing down results with selected filters\n- Main User UI fully written in Node JS. \n- Main User UI support for all browsers. Including legacy and mobile browsers.\n- Underlying use of a NoSQL database \n- Robust integration current editor and admin interfaces",
