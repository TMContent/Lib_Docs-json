<p>Filters are divided into categories for easier organization.</p>
<ul>
<li>The &quot;Technology&quot; filter - the technology filter allows the user to display only the articles that pertain to a specific technology. For example Microsoft .NET. <em>Technology Independent</em> filter means that the articles it selects do not belong to a specific technology, and the prescriptions in that guidance can be applied universally.</li>
<li>The &quot;Phase&quot; filter - the phase filter allows the user to select only the articles that apply to a specific software development life-cycle phase.</li>
<li>The &quot;Type&quot; filter - the type filter allows the user to choose what types of articles to display. The most common types are &quot;Checklists&quot; and &quot;Guidelines&quot;. &quot;Guidelines&quot; describe how to do something in general terms that should be applicable to most applications, but still specific enough to be implemented. A &quot;Checklist&quot; describes how to test if a specific security measure or control has been implemented correctly and how to implement it correctly. Checklists and &quot;Guidelines&quot; usually exist in pairs. Other types of articles include: &quot;Vulnerability&quot;, &quot;Code Example&quot;, &quot;How To&quot;,  and &quot;Principle&quot;</li>
</ul>
