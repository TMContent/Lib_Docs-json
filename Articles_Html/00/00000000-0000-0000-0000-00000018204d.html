<p>Searching is the simplest way of finding content in TEAM Mentor. However, search requires you to know a little bit about the subject at hand. Use the &quot;Search&quot; function when you have formulated a security question. Simply go to the &quot;Search&quot; page and type your query in the search box.</p>
<p>(note that currently search supports simple queries only. Boolean operators such as AND OR NOT are planned for future release)</p>
