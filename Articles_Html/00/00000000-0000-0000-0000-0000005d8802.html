<strong>Show Content to Anonymous Users</strong> (true)-  (depreciated, should always be set to false) This setting defines whether or not full articles will be displayed to unauthenticated users.<br>
<strong>Show Library to Anonymous Users</strong>(true) - (depreciated, should always be set to false) This setting defines whether or not library structure is displayed to unauthenticated users. In case this is unchecked and  "Show Content to Anonymous Users" is disabled, all the user will see is a login screen when accessing TEAM Mentor<br>
<strong>SSL Redirect Http to Https</strong> (true)- This setting redirects all non SSL traffic, except for traffic coming from localhost, to SSL port. This ensures all TEAM Mentor traffic is protected using SSL.<br>
<strong>New Accounts Enabled</strong> (true)- Activates / Deactivates the user approval workflow. If this is unchecked, all users that sign up will have to be approved by the administrator. See <a href="00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000001c8add">Managing Users</a><br>
<strong>New Accounts Don't Expire</strong>(false) - Specifies if new accounts created by users signing up have an expiration date<br>
<strong>Eval Accounts Enabled</strong> (true)- This setting specifies if unauthenticated users will be able to create accounts on the system for Evaluation purposes (only works if ShowContentToAnonymousUsers=false) (note: due to current limitation, if set to "false" users are still able to create accounts on the system which will not expire, see <a href="00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000005d8802">Managing Users for workaround</a>)<br>
