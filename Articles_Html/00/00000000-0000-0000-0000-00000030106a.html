<h1>Unzip of the install file requires a passwrd</h1><p>Paid content of TEAM Mentor is distributed via a zip file. However, users can sometimes see this error. This error will be shown by Microsoft unzip program if the destination path is greater then 260 characters. This is the limit in most Windows APIs. To fix, unzip the files into c:\tmp or similar directory with a short name. This will shorten the destination path and allow the unzip operation. Note that other unzip programs such as WinRar will show correct error message, reflecting the file path limit being exceeded.
