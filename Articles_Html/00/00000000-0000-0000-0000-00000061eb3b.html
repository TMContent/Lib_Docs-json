<p>TEAM Mentor provides two main avenues for accessing the vast content we offer. &quot;Searching and Filtering&quot;, and &quot;Index Navigation&quot;. Each aiming at providing the answers you are looking for in the least amounts of clicks. The best method to use depends on your goal.</p>
<p>If you have a specific question, and know what you are looking for, then simply use the &quot;search and filter&quot; .</p>
<p>If you are not sure what you are interested in, or simply would like to browse our content, use the &quot;Index&quot; directory to go through a list of topics until you find one that deserves your further attention.</p>
<p><strong>The Main User Interface Has Two Areas.</strong></p>
<p>The Top Menu. Which provides access to the &quot;Search&quot; and &quot;Index&quot; functionality, as well as access to this documentation. And the workspace below which changes based on the functionality chose.</p>

<p><strong>Search Results Page</strong></p>
<p>Search Results Page displays the list of articles that match your query. The number of articles shown is displayed on top.</p>
<p>The articles are numbered based on relevance to your query.</p>
<p>Icon's next to the articles provide visual queues representing their relationship to a filter.</p>
<p>The filters on your right help narrow down the search results. Read more about the filters <a href="00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000001a9296">here</a></p>

<p><strong>Article View Page</strong></p>
<p>Article view page provides easy, distraction free, way of reading and understanding the content. Each guidance type has a slightly different format. However, most start by explaining the issue at high level, continue into prescriptive details, include problem and solution examples, and are followed by additional reading references.</p>
<p>Open the article view page by clicking on the title of the article on ether &quot;Search&quot; or &quot;Index&quot; Page.</p>
<p>Go back to the list by using your browsers &quot;Back&quot; button. Some people also prefer to open articles in separate tabs, by right-clicking on the article title and selecting &quot;Open in new tab&quot;</p>
