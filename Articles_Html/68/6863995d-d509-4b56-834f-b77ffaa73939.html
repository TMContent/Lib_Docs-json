<p>Unfortunately, HP Fortify does not provide an interface to update the custom rulepacks. To update TEAM Mentor custom rulepack you must manually remove it from directory:
</p>
<p>
<em>%ProgramFiles%\HP_Fortify\HP_Fortify_SCA_and_Apps_4.00\Core\config\customrules</em>
</p><p>
By deleting  <strong>TEAMMentorRulePack.xml</strong> file and Installing the Custom Rulepack again.
