<strong>What if we don’t have guidance for a particular finding? </strong>
</p><p>
Some Fortify findings do not have associated TEAM Mentor guidance.  In this case you will not see “Custom Explanation” and “Custom Recommendation” provided by TEAM Mentor. You will see regular Fortify provided guidance.
