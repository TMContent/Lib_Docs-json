<p>To see the TEAM Mentor Eclipse Plugin for Fortify at work you can scan a sample, purposely vulnerable application. For this we have chosen “BodgeIt Store” – A vulnerable web application aimed at people new to pen testing.  You can read more about the application here:

Follow these steps to download, import and scan the application:
