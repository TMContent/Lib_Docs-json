<p>Open Fortify Perspective and Findings<br>
In this example we have a project with a simple, vulnerable, application. </p><ul>
<li>Analyze the project by going to HP Fortify-&gt;Analyze Project <br>
or <br></li>
<li>Open an already saved analysis by going to HP Fortify -&gt; Load Saved Audit Project or HP Fortify -&gt; Open Audit Project <br>
This brings up the Fortify Audit perspective <br> <br>

As you can see TEAM Mentor guidance is automatically displayed whenever a Fortify finding is selected in the SCA Analysis Results view.
