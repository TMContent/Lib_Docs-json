          "====Is Cat.NET used behind the scenes of the TEAM Mentor Visual Studio Plugin?====\nYes the tool we integrated into TEAM Mentor Visual Studio Plug-in is Microsoft's Cat.NET v1 CTP which you can download from here [[http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=19968]]\n\n====What type of support is offered for Cat.NET tool?====\nThis is an official Microsoft tool and while Microsoft does not plan on releasing a new version soon, SI is now supporting the TEAM Mentor + Visual Studio + Cat.NET plug-in. Therefore SI is providing support for the Cat.NET portion of the TEAM Mentor Visual Studio Plugin.\n\n====Is it true that Cat.NET will not work with .NET versions greater than 2.0?====\nCat.NET is able to scan all (currently released) versions of the .NET Framework (not just 2.0). Note that on the default install of the Cat.NET add-in, there is no support for Visual Studio 2010, but that is a configuration change (the TEAM Mentor Visual Studio Plugin automatically installs this Add-In and configures it accordingly)\nThis is a YouTube Video showing it in action: TM - Install and demo of Visual Studio Extension with Cat.NET integration v1.0 [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeI3POSpAvQ]] \n\n\n\n"
