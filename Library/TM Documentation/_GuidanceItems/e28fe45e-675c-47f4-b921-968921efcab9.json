          "Git support for TM_Libraries allows installation and dynamic updates of TEAM Mentor Libraries from a git server, such as github. Once configured, TEAM Mentor will automatically pull the latest version of the library from the configured repository and will push any content changes (given sufficient permissions) to the same repository.  This feature effectively de-couples content updates from TEAM Mentor code updates. It is now possible to always have the latest version of the library.  This feature also enables content version control and facilitates collaboration among content authors. Finally this feature allows you to automatically merge the latest public content with any company specific, or local content, seamlessly , ensuring latest information is always at the fingertips of people that need it the most. \n\nTEAM Mentor will automatically pull the latest content from the repository on following events:\n\n- server/iis-worker-process restart\\\\\n- cache reload \\\\\n- content save \\\\\n"
