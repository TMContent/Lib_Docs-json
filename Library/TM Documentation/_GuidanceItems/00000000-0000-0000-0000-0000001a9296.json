Only one filter can be removed at a time. Removal of the filter returns the set of articles to a state before that filter was applied.\r\n   \r\n   \r\n![](/Image/filters-ng-03.png)    \r\n    \r\n    \r\nFilters are divided into categories for easier organization. \r\n   \r\n   \r\n- The \"Technology\" filter - the technology filter allows the user to display only the articles that pertain to a specific technology. For example Microsoft .NET. _Technology Independent_ filter means that the articles it selects do not belong to a specific technology, and the prescriptions in that guidance can be applied universally. \r\n- The \"Phase\" filter - the phase filter allows the user to select only the articles that apply to a specific software development life-cycle phase.\r\n- The \"Type\" filter - the type filter allows the user to choose what types of articles to display. The most common types are \"Checklists\" and \"Guidelines\". \"Guidelines\" describe how to do something in general terms that should be applicable to most applications, but still specific enough to be implemented. A \"Checklist\" describes how to test if a specific security measure or control has been implemented correctly and how to implement it correctly. Checklists and \"Guidelines\" usually exist in pairs. Other types of articles include: \"Vulnerability\", \"Code Example\", \"How To\",  and \"Principle\"\r\n"
