The page you see immediately after login is the search page. Simply type your query in the search bar. \\\\\nYou can return to this page at any time by clicking \"Search\" on the top menu.\n\n{{/Image/search01.png}}\n\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\nThe main search page also shows your last three recently viewed articles, the three most popular trending search terms in TEAM Mentor, and the top three articles viewed on the site. \\\\\n(Note that when you first sign up there will not be any recently viewed articles on the page)\n\n{{/Image/search02.png}}\n\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\nOnce the search results are shown, you can see the total article count. You can further narrow down the search by using one or more filters on the right. The numbers next to the filters represent the number of articles each filter selects.\n\n{{/Image/search03.png}}\n\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\nIcons next to the articles correspond to filters on the right. Making it easier to identify articles at a glance.\n\n{{/Image/search04.png}}\n\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\nYou can easily remove any filter by clicking on the \"X\"  next to it.\n\n\n{{/Image/search05.png}}\n\n\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\n===Browsing==\n\nYou may choose to to browse for content is by using the \"Index\" page. This is useful when you would like to discover the information we have.  Click on \"Index\" in the upper right.\n\nThe index page is comprised of 3 main components. The subject matter taxonomy on the left, the filters on the right, and the list of available articles in the middle. \n\n{{/Image/index01.png}}\n\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\nYou start to navigate the \"Index\" by ether selecting a subject of interest on the left, or a filter on the right. You may continue to select ether filters or subjects of interest until you find a list of articles that you would like to read. Then simply open the article by clicking on its title.\n\nGo back to the list by using your browsers \"Back\" button. Some people also prefer to open articles in separate tabs, by right-clicking on the article title and selecting \"Open in new tab\"\n\nNumbers next to each subject on the left represent the number of articles that exists for that subject. When you select a subject of interest. You drill down further into specific sub-topics in that subject. Narrowing down the list of articles. Bread crumb navigation on top, shows exactly where you are in the taxonomy. \n\n\n{{/Image/index02.png}}\n\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\n{{/Image/index03.png}}\n\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\n{{/Image/index04.png}}\n\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\nAt any time you may select a filter on the right to narrow down the displayed list of articles further. Numbers next to the filter represent the number of articles this filter selects.\n\n{{/Image/index05.png}}\n\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\n{{/Image/index06.png}}\n\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\nYou may also start your navigation with selecting one or more filter. Once selected, subject directory on the left updates, showing only available topics for the filter(s) \n\n{{/Image/index07.png}}\n\n\nAs you can see, the combination of the topics and filters creates a powerful browsing mechanism that allows you to reach the desired articles quickly and intuitively. \n\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\n=Example #1 – Find Information about SQL Injection==\n\nOn the \"Search\" page, type //sql injection// and hit <enter> or click the search icon. \n\n{{/Image/example1-01.png}}\n\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\nThe search query returns a number of results. We can look through those or narrow down results using filters. Let’s look for .NET specific guidance by selecting the .NET filter\n\n{{/Image/example1-02.png}}\n\n\\\\\n\n{{/Image/example1-03.png}}\n\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\nYou can further narrow down the search results or simply open the most relevant article displayed on top  by clicking on the title.\n\n{{/Image/example1-04.png}}\n\n\\\\\n\n{{/Image/example1-05.png}}\n\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\n==Example #2 – Discover Authentication Best Practices for .NET==\n\nNow let’s practice using Index. In this example, we will identify the authentication best practices for .NET. It’s very simple, all we have to do is select .NET filter on the index page and then select \"Authentication\" from the subject directory.\n\n{{/Image/example2-01.png}}\n\n\\\\\n\n{{/Image/example2-02.png}}\n\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\nThe query returns a number of results. \n\n{{/Image/example2-03.png}}\n\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\nWe can further narrow down the list of articles by selecting a sub-category from the subject directory. \n\n\n{{/Image/example2-04.png}}\n\n\\\\\n\n{{/Image/example2-05.png}}\n\n\n\nFurther narrow this down to show just How To articles by checking How To in the Type filter list:\n\n{{/Image/example2-06.png}}\n\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\nThis returns a small relevant number of articles.\n\n{{/Image/example2-07.png}}\n\n\\\\\n\n==Example #3 – Finding Information on a Vulnerability (XSS Example)==\nOne example of how you can use TEAM Mentor is to look for information you need regarding specific software vulnerabilities. This may be because you wish to avoid this vulnerability in your code, you have been assigned to fix a vulnerability, or are just looking for information on the topic. To do this, after you have successfully authenticated, Search for //XSS// (in this example) on the search page.\n\n{{/Image/example3-01.png}}\n\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\nSelect \"Vulnerability\" type in the Filters list..\n\n{{/Image/example3-02.png}}\n\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\nYou are presented with a few relative articles. If you look closely, the articles relate to specific technology. This is indicated by the icon next to the article summary. \n{{/Image/example3-03.png}}\n\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\nSelect a \"Technology Independent\" filter. This filter shows articles not related to a particular technology. This would show you generic article for this vulnerability.\n\n\n{{/Image/example3-04.png}}\n\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\nOpen the article and read for specific information on how to fix the vulnerability.\n\n{{/Image/example3-05.png}}\n\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\n\n==Sharing information on vulnerability==\nYou may wish to share this information once you found it for collaboration on a fix, testing, or using the information to avoid that vulnerability in your code. Once you have opened a vulnerability (of any other) article you would like to share, simply copy the URL on the URL bar\n\n{{/Image/sharing01.png}}\n\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\n==Saving information on vulnerability==\nIf you would like to save an article for later reference, after you’ve opened the article in full view, simply use your browser’s bookmarking feature to bookmark the article. The URL of articles do not change, so when you use the bookmark you will be taken right to the article. If you are not logged in, you will have to log in to see the article\n\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\n==Save or Share Your Results=\n\nIf you created a complex query and would like to share the resulting list of articles, or reuse the same filter later, simply bookmark or email the URL of the page you are on. \n\nThe URL always reflects the state of the application, therefore it is easy to save or share what you are seeing with anyone else.\n\n\nSearch and filter, or browse, to the list of articles that you like.\n\n{{/Image/sharing02.png}}\n\n\\\\\n\n{{/Image/sharing03.png}}\n\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\nThen use your browser to bookmark the URL, which saves the state for future re-use. When you click on the bookmark, it will open TEAM Mentor with the same search and filters and thus display the same set of articles.\nYou can also send the same URL to anyone that has access to TEAM Mentor. When they click on the URL, they will see the same set of articles. This makes collaboration on fixing security defects as easy as sending an IM or email between colleges. \n\n{{/Image/sharing04.png}}\n\n\n\n\n"
