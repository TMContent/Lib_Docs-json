That is why we make the sign up process as quick as possible. We only ask for information that is absolutely required to create your account. Your username, you password, and an email address we can send the password reset link, if you happen to need it.\r\n\r\n![](/Image/signup02.png)\r\n\r\nClicking the \"Sign Up\" button submits the entered information. If the submitted information is valid, a new account is created and can be used to access the application.\r\n\r\n. "
