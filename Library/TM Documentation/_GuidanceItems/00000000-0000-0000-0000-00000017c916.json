          "This article will explain how to install TeamTeamor in a local computer from an GitHub Repository, in this case the TEAM Mentor Evaluation version which contains the full TEAM Mentor Engine and an OWASP Top 10 Library [[https://github.com/TMContent/Lib_OWASP|https://github.com/TMContent/Lib_OWASP]]\n\nIn the target machine make sure IIS and TortoiseGit is installed. (Tortoise can be installed from [[https://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/|here]].) Also make sure you have a valid github account. No special permissions are needed for the account.\n \n#Create a folder to hold your GitHub Clones. In this example we are going to use: //C:\\TEAM Mentor_From_GitHub//\n#In the //C:\\TEAM Mentor_From_GitHub// folder right-click inside it, and chose from the Context Menu the option //'Git Clone'//\n#In a browser open the page: [[https://github.com/TEAM Mentor/Master]], click on the //'Git Read-only'// button and copy the url to its right (in this case [[git://github.com/TEAM Mentor/Master.git]]). If you want to make commits from this version, you will need to use an account with push privileges to this repository.\n#Back in the Git Clone Gui, put the Git url in the 'Url' TextBox ([[git://github.com/TEAM Mentor/Master.git]]) and set the 'Directory' TextBox to //'C:\\TEAM Mentor_From_GitHub\\Master'//). Click OK\n#The //'C:\\TEAM Mentor_From_GitHub\\Master'// should now be populated with a number of files and folders. \n#Now you need to install the OWASP library. Follow the instructions under **Installing TEAM Mentor Library from Github** in [[article/00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000005b52c6|Installing Libraries]] and use https://[USERNAME]:[PASSWORD]@github.com/TMContent/Lib_OWASP.git ( replacing [USERNAME] and [PASSWORD] with your github credentials) in the appropriate place as described."
